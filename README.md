# FocusTracker
Track your focus blocks during the day

The idea of creating this script is to track my periods of focus during any given day. I use an online white noise generator while I am trying to focus on something (as I usually work in a noisy environment :cry:) and this script reads the play and pause patterns of the white noise generator and outputs your focus blocks.

You need Python3 and 'selenium' python module installed on your machine to run this script. If you have selenium setup already on your machine, you can just directly run main.py. If not, proceed to install selenium
1. Clone this repository somewhere on your machine and navigate to its parent directory in command prompt/terminal
2. pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Download the chrome driver from the downloads page below and Update the PATH environment variable with the driver's location

4. Run main.py to track your focus blocks :smile:
